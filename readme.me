#  Ivana Grace: Passion Meets Purpose

Welcome to the official capstone project for **I Grace**, a modern, vibrant website designed for a professional independent vocalist, singer, and songwriter. This project is a reflection of both technical development skills and creative storytellingâ€”where design meets soul, and purpose meets functionality.

##  Project Overview

This project was developed as part of my Front-End Web Development capstone. It is a multi-page, fully responsive website that incorporates essential development skills such as:

- HTML5 semantic structure
- Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS frameworks
- JavaScript interactivity and DOM manipulation
- External API integration with `axios` and `fetch`
- Accessible and responsive user interfaces

The goal was to design a clean, functional, and engaging website 
that not only showcases an artist's brand but also adheres to strong development
 best practices.
